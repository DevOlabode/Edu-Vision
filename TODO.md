# TODO: Restyle Study Notes Section in materialDetail.ejs

## Approved Plan Steps
1. Update the study notes card header: Change background from gradient to subtle gray/blue (e.g., background: #e9ecef; color: #495057;), remove gradients and shadows.
2. Update the study notes card body: Remove gradient background, use plain white or light gray (e.g., background: #ffffff;), reduce padding if needed for minimalism.
3. Simplify study-notes-content styles:
   - Bullets: Remove gradients and shadows, use simple border-left in subtle blue, plain background.
   - Numbered lists: Use plain numbered circles without gradients.
   - Headings: Change to subtle gray background, remove gradients and text shadows.
   - Paragraphs: Clean white background with minimal border in subtle blue, no gradients or heavy shadows.
4. Ensure changes are isolated to the study notes section only.
