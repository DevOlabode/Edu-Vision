# TODO: Improve Task Management Views and Add Milestone Functionality

## Information Gathered
- **Show Page (show.ejs)**: Currently displays task details in a basic card layout. Needs restyling for better visual appeal and addition of milestone management functionality (add new milestones).
- **All Tasks Page (allTasks.ejs)**: Card-based layout exists but needs improved styling for better user experience.
- **New Task Page (newTask.ejs)**: Form layout exists but needs enhanced styling and visual improvements.
- **Milestone Addition**: Need to implement functionality to add new milestones to existing tasks, saving to database.

## Plan
- **Edit `views/student/task/show.ejs`**:
  - Restyle the page with improved layout, colors, and spacing.
  - Add a collapsible form section for adding new milestones.
  - Include form with title and due date fields for new milestones.
- **Add Milestone Addition Backend**:
  - Add `addMilestone` method to `controllers/student/task.js`.
  - Add POST route `/task/:id/milestone` in `routes/student/task.js`.
- **Style `views/student/task/allTasks.ejs`**:
  - Enhance card styling with better shadows, gradients, and hover effects.
  - Improve badge styling and layout.
- **Style `views/student/task/newTask.ejs`**:
  - Improve form styling with better input designs, spacing, and visual hierarchy.
  - Enhance milestone section with better UI for adding/removing milestones.
